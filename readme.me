## NodeJS/TypeScript Word Counter Application

### Cloud Applied Project Generative AI Engineer (Batch 53 Quarter 1)


This code implements a simple word counter that takes user input and counts the number of characters and words.

It uses inquirer to prompt the user for input. The input is stored in the 'text' variable.

It counts characters by getting the length of the input string.

It counts words by splitting the input string on whitespace using a regex, and getting the length of the resulting array.

It prints the character and word counts using chalk for colored output.

The character and word counts are the main outputs of this code.
